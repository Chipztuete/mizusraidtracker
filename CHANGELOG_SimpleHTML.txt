	<li>Added new export format: BBcode formatted text with wowhead links</li>
	<li>UI 'Add/modify'-dialog: Added a dropdown menu with a list of available players.</li>
	<li>Added boss detection for Iron Council (Molgeim last) and Algalon on german (deDE) clients. (Thanks to Fr√ºchtchen)</li>
	<li>Added localization files for esMX, koKR, ruRU, zhCN, zhTW. Zone name translations are included. This should provide basic tracking support for the corresponding WoW-Clients.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Updates:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Updated frFR localization (Thanks to Cyliah)</li>
</ul>
<strong>Changes:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>MRT now supports data exports of a running raid.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Bug Fixes:</strong>
<ul>
	<li> Fixed a lua-error which occured at the very last part of the Lich King fight. Because of that, the kill detection for the Iron Council (Stellbraker last) is deactivated once again, because both bosses use the same emote. This will be fixed in the next release. Hopefully. (Ticket ID 13)</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue with the CTRT-Export, which produced a wrong time format on Mac system. (Ticket ID 6)</li>
	<li>Fixed a lua-error, which occured, if data of a raidmember wasn't available at scan time.</li>

<h4>0.21 Beta - Changelog:</h4>
<strong>New:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Added support and a complete UI translation for spanish (esES) clients (a big thanks to Hestrall, who translated 90% of the addon).
(Note: Boss yells for Halion, Horde Gunship Battle, TotC bosses and Ulduar bosses are still missing. For specific boss support, see <a href="http://wow.curseforge.com/addons/mizusraidtracker/pages/translation-status/">the translation status page at CurseForge.com</a>).</li>
	<li>Added buttons to the GUI for starting and ending raid tracking manually.</li>
	<li>CTRT-Export: added a workaround for a problem with an unknown EQDKP-RaidImport-Plugin (probably the "RaidTracker Import"-Plugin by d23)</li>
</ul>
<strong>Changes:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Updated german (deDE) translation (thanks to gOOvER)</li>
    <li>The localization files are now created automatically by the CurseForge-Packager. If there are any issues, please report them.</li>
</ul>

<strong>New:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Added regularly check for PlayerDB and delete unused entries.</li>
	<li>Added a LibDataBroker data source for opening the raidlog and the options panel</li>
</ul>
<strong>Changes:</strong>
<ul>
	<li> 'Add Bosskill' dialog: Deleted the user dialog, which asked, if raid attendees should be copied to the boss attendees list. This is now done by default. Since raid attendee data takes priority over boss attendee data since v0.17, having this optional didn't make sense anymore.</li>
	<li>Updated deDE translation.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Bug Fixes:</strong>
<ul>
	<li> Changed layout of the boss kill table slightly. The last column shouldn't cut off anymore.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Added very basic support for french EU-clients (Gunship Battle, Dreamwalker, Blood Prince Council and Halion kill detection will not work)</li>
</ul>
<strong>Bug Fixes:</strong>
<ul>
	<li> The CTRT-compatible raid export shouldn't export duplicated player exports. This should fix an issue with the Raidlogimport-Plugin for EQDKP-Plus</li>
	<li>Updated NPC ID conversion for Patch 4.0.1 (should fix boss detection)</li>
	<li>Updated item string handling (Patch 4.0.1 issue)</li>
