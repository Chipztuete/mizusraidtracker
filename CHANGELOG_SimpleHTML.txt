(Note: Boss yells for Halion, Horde Gunship Battle, TotC bosses and Ulduar bosses are still missing. For specific boss support, see <a href="http://wow.curseforge.com/addons/mizusraidtracker/pages/translation-status/">the translation status page at CurseForge.com</a>).</li>
	<li>Added buttons to the GUI for starting and ending raid tracking manually.</li>
	<li>CTRT-Export: added a workaround for a problem with an unknown EQDKP-RaidImport-Plugin (probably the "RaidTracker Import"-Plugin by d23)</li>
</ul>
<strong>Changes:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Updated german (deDE) translation (thanks to gOOvER)</li>

	<li> 'Add Bosskill' dialog: Deleted the user dialog, which asked, if raid attendees should be copied to the boss attendees list. This is now done by default. Since raid attendee data takes priority over boss attendee data since v0.17, having this optional didn't make sense anymore.</li>
	<li>Updated deDE translation.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Bug Fixes:</strong>
<ul>
	<li> Changed layout of the boss kill table slightly. The last column shouldn't cut off anymore.</li>
</ul>
