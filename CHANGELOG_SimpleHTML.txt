<strong>New:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Added regularly check for PlayerDB and delete unused entries.</li>
	<li>Added a LibDataBroker data source for opening the raidlog and the options panel</li>
</ul>
<strong>Changes:</strong>
<ul>
	<li> 'Add Bosskill' dialog: Deleted the user dialog, which asked, if raid attendees should be copied to the boss attendees list. This is now done by default. Since raid attendee data takes priority over boss attendee data since v0.17, having this optional didn't make sense anymore.</li>
	<li>Updated deDE translation.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Bug Fixes:</strong>
<ul>
	<li> Changed layout of the boss kill table slightly. The last column shouldn't cut off anymore.</li>

</ul>
<strong>Bug Fixes:</strong>
<ul>
	<li> The CTRT-compatible raid export shouldn't export duplicated player exports. This should fix an issue with the Raidlogimport-Plugin for EQDKP-Plus</li>

	<li>Updated item string handling (Patch 4.0.1 issue)</li>

<h4>0.17 Beta - Changelog:</h4>
<strong>New:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Added option for disabling boss based attendee data for  CTRT-export (if you only create one raid entry for each raid in your  EQDKP(-Plus) and make corrections to raid members manually, you might want  to activate this option)</li>
	<li> Added checks to prevent exporting of an active raid (raid data is incomplete until a raid is finished)</li>
	<li> Added option for disabling the confirmation box for an attendance check.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Changes:</strong>
<ul>
	<li> Rewritten large parts of the CTRT-Export. Raid attendee data now  take priority over boss attendee data. This should fix the Join/Leave  timestamps and provide correct information for time based DKP systems  (Thanks to Omega for pointing that out)</li>
	<li> Disconnecting players are now treated as leaving players, if "Track offline players" is disabled.</li>
	<li> In 10/25 raids, players moved in groups &gt;2/&gt;5 are now  treated as leaving players, if "Track only first 2/5 groups" is enabled.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Bug Fixes:</strong>
<ul>
	<li> Fixed nasty bug, which could enable previously disabled options (please check your settings in the option menu)</li>
</ul>
